    <p>Hello, my name is Lucas! I'm a brazilian software developer with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. I have been working with software development since 2014, mostly with back-end web development, but I am always looking to expand the horizons of my knowledge.</p>
